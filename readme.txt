A modern WordPress mail delivery plugin routing wp_mail() through Symfony Mailer, with queues, failover, webhooks, and observability.

== Description ==

Jooosi Mail is a modern email sending solution for WordPress sites. It routes WordPress email through configurable providers, records delivery activity, supports queue-based processing, and provides operational visibility for sent, queued, and failed messages.

### Features

* **Multiple provider support**: Use SMTP or popular email services from one plugin.
* **Queue-based delivery**: Queue busy sending periods and process messages with Action Scheduler.
* **Provider failover**: Fall back to another connection when a provider is unavailable.
* **Email logs**: Review sent, queued, failed, and webhook-related activity.
* **Webhook feedback**: Supported providers can report deliveries, bounces, complaints, opens, and clicks back to WordPress.
* **Admin and CLI workflows**: Manage Jooosi Mail from the WordPress dashboard or WP-CLI.

### External services

Jooosi Mail routes WordPress emails through third-party email service providers. No data is sent to any external service unless the site administrator explicitly configures a connection to that provider.

When Jooosi Mail sends an email, the following data is transmitted to the configured provider:

- Email content (subject, body, headers)
- Recipient address(es)
- Sender address (From, Reply-To)
- Attachments (if any)

This data is sent only when WordPress processes queued or immediate emails (via `wp_mail()` or Action Scheduler). Jooosi Mail does not collect or transmit any data independently.

If webhooks are enabled for a supported provider, that provider may send delivery, bounce, complaint, open, and click data back to your WordPress site.
